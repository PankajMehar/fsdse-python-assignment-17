# Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.

**Notes:**
* Use operator module in python.
* Define two different functions
    * One to get ascending order of dict
    * Two to get descending order of dict.

**Instructions:**
* Program should be written in file build.py
* Function names should be solution_asc and solution_desc for ascending and descending sorts respectively.
* Input 
      
       Type:  Dictionary
       Value: {1: 2, 3: 4, 4: 3, 2: 1, 0: 0}
       
* Expected Output

        Type:  List
        Value: In ascending order it should be:  [(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 3)]
               In descending order it should be: [(4, 3), (3, 4), (2, 1), (1, 2), (0, 0)]
